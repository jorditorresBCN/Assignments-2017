# Practical assignments

There will be two kinds of assignments: five labs and one project. Some lab sessions include pre-session homework. Students are expected to complete and submit the assigned pre-lab homework before each lab session.

## Labs
Students will begin by creating a basic toolbox to get started in the Cloud. It will prepare them to be able to practice with APIs, the doors in the Cloud. That will also allow students to be able mine the deluge of data coming from the Cloud, or use new advanced analytics services available nowadays in the Cloud. Finally, we will look under the hood of these advanced analytics services in the Cloud, either in terms of software or hardware, in order to understand how their high performance requirements can be provided. The final goal is to provide code examples that can get you started easily.

- Lab 1: [Basic "Knowledge Toolbox" to getting started in the Cloud][Lab1] **10%**
- Lab 2: [Doors in the Cloud][Lab2]                                        **20%**
- Lab 3: [Extracting and Analyzing data from the Cloud][Lab3]              **20%**
- Lab 4: [Interacting with users and services in the Cloud][Lab4]          **20%** + **5% (optional part)**
- Lab 5: [Under the hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services][Lab5]       **20%** + **5% (optional part)**

## Course Project
The course project can be done in groups of 1,2 or 3 students.  The students' proposal of the course project needs to be approved by the teacher before starting to develop. 

**Six levels:** 
* **Minimum (max  grade obtained 60%)**: One possible project idea is to prepare a presentation regarding technologies related to this part of the course (using slides).
* **Medium (max grade obtained 90%)**: Another project alternative is to create a self-contained practical guide (hands-on guide) that helps the reader in learning one of the latest cloud technologies.

* **Full (option 1)**:  The standard project is to create an application using existing APIs. [Starting here for more information](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/02/6-deep-learning-applications-beginner-python/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29). For example:  
  * Colorize photos using Deep Learning  with Algorithmia API
  * Building a ChatBot using Watson API
  * News Aggregator based on Sentiment Analysis using Aylien API
  
* **Full (option 2)**:  Carry out one of the projects suggested by the professor during this course.
  
* **Advanced (option 1) (bonus of +10%)**  The project offers an excellent opportunity for the students to dive into course content by implementing a protoype (proof of concept implementation of a business idea created by the students) using some of the latest Cloud technology. Your teacher will be deligted to help you.

* **Advanced (option 2) (bonus of +10%)**  Surprise the teacher with a project proposal that he accepts.

## Deadlines
#### Deadlines for Labs
The indicated deadlines are simply suggestions for you to ideally finish each hands-on assignment. They are meant to help you keeping on track and maintaining an appropriate pace throughout the program. There are no penalties if you miss the deadlines. It is a recommended best practice trying to meet each suggested deadline.
#### Deadline for the course Project
The deadlines indicated in the course syllabus are a hard deadline.
